JP Framework based on Twitter Bootstrap

Welcome to JPFramework.

JPFramework is a Joomla! template framework for building websites based on the well know Twitter Bootstrap framework. This package includes a component and a template.

How it works?

The JPFramework component manage small portions of code called Blocks, this blocks are asigned to a template positions then the template render this blocks respecting the order and the language. Every block has it owns settings using a xml form as is usual in Joomla.

Creating custom blocks

Create custom blocks easily. The main component has several preinstalled examples. For each new block, you only need a new subfolder in the blocks folder and edit the block.php file with the necessary XML code for the options block form. Additionally, each block can have its own assets folder with custom stylesheets, scripts or images.

If you need more blocks check my other repository https://github.com/jprojects/blocks.
